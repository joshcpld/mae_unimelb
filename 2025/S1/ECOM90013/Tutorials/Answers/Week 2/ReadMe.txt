Daniel has written a program to do things in R, called Week2.R.

I tend to use Matlab and so I have included a folder that contains my
original solutions, called Matlab Solutions.  The graphs were created
in Matlab using the file Exercise2.m and then exported to individual
.tex files using the matlab2tikz package )in Matlab), which creates
code for use with the tikz package in LaTeX. All the details are in
Week_2_Solutions.tex.

Enjoy!

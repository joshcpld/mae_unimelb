A sparse matrix is a matrix when it has MANY zeros. Storing its dense form is a huge waste of memory. For example, a matrix\n","$$A=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n","0 & 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$$\n","can be saved in a 3-row, 3-column data frame.\n","\n","Or, we can observe that the first row and first column is a value $1$, the first row and second column is a value $2$. Therefore, we can use their coordinates to represent the matrix elements and ignore all zeros. For this example, we can have\n","\n","| Row | Column | Value |\n","|----------|----------|----------|\n","| 1   | 1   | 1   |\n","| 1   | 2   | 2   |\n","| 2   | 3   | 1   |\n","| 3   | 1   | 1   |\n","\n","For this example, the sparse representation is not very efficient in memory saving. But you can look into the `player` file and make a simple calculate to check the necessity of using a sparse matrix. How many elements do you need in the matrix if in a dense form for data `player`?\n","\n","The configuration file need to add one more zero row. Why? Need field knowledge. It took me quite some time to figure this out. A zero row in `config` means that none of the events happened. So you may see many zero-valued rows in config file.
